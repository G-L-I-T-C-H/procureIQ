    Using the Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM, validate the {topic} input to ensure it contains the required criteria: quantity (e.g., "50 units"), what to acquire (e.g., "computers"), and deadline (e.g., "2-week delivery"). If any criteria are missing, save the provided input to partial_rfx_input.json, prompt the user to provide the missing details, and wait for updated input. Once all criteria are present, combine the saved input from partial_rfx_input.json with the new input to create a professional RFx document for suppliers. Ensure the document includes the following mandatory fields in the header:
    - RFQ Number: {rfq_number}
    - Issue Date: {issue_date}
    - Submission Deadline: {submission_deadline}
    - Issued By: {issued_by}
    - Contact Person: {contact_person}
    - Email: {email}
    - Phone: {phone}
    - Closing Salutation with a closing statement, name of the issuer (Procurement Manager), and organisation name
    Structure the requirements section to include:
    - Quantity: Extracted from the input (e.g., "50 Units").
    - Type: Specify the item type (e.g., "Laptops and Desktops") based on the "what to acquire" input.
    - Specifications: A flat list of 4 key specifications (e.g., Processor, RAM, Storage, OS) derived from the input or default business specs.
    - Detailed Configurations: Additional details for laptops and desktops in a nested list (e.g., display size, connectivity).
    - Warranty: Minimum warranty period (e.g., "3 years") from the input.
    - Delivery: Target delivery timeline (e.g., "2 weeks") from the input.
